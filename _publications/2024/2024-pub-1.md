  Proportionality is a core principle in modern criminal law, reflecting the retributivist goal of matching the severity of punishments with the gravity of crime. However, from a utilitarian perspective, proportionality may be less important, and can even be sacrificed for enhancing crime deterrence and social efficiency. Are proportionality and utilitarianism compatible? We empirically examine whether more proportionate punishment conflicts with utilitarian goals, using China's 2016 reform aimed at reducing harsh punishments for crimes of embezzlement and bribery as evidence. Employing a novel municipal-level panel dataset on embezzlement crimes, bribery crimes, and misappropriation of public funds crimes from 2001 to 2020 and using a generalized difference-in-differences model to assess pre- and post-reform variations, we find that the reform succeeded in reducing the severity of punishments, not only because of the relaxation of penal standards, but also because offenders no longer have strong opportunistic incentives to commit serious crimes under a more reasonable hierarchy of marginal deterrence. Although the reform led to an overall increase in the number of crimes due to reduced deterrence, most of the increase is concentrated in minor offenses. In conclusion, the reform did not cause more severe social harm. These findings suggest that proportionality is compatible with utilitarianism and should also be an important consideration within the utilitarian framework, providing key insights for countries considering reducing excessively severe punishments.
