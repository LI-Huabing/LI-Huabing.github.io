  Along with the continuous reconstruction of the traditional social science academic research paradigm by big data technology, unstructured textual data has increasingly become an important reliance for empirical research in many fields. While traditional empirical research in social sciences is mostly based on structured data such as macro statistics, questionnaires, company financial reports and stock market prices, the emergence of text sentiment analysis methods in NLP and CS has greatly expanded the data sources and research fields of empirical research in social sciences, and profoundly changed and reshaped the face of empirical research in social sciences. Currently, text sentiment analysis methods broadly include dictionary-based methods, machine-learning-based methods and deep-learning-based methods. Among them, dictionary-based methods are mostly adopted by social science researchers due to their simple computation, easy understanding, high reliability and low cost. However, as there are still few mature dictionaries for Chinese text sentiment analysis and a lack of highly specialized domain dictionaries, there is still room for further improvement in the accuracy of text sentiment analysis. How to further improve the accuracy of text sentiment analysis without introducing artificially labeled training data? In this paper, an adaptive improvement method of Chinese text sentiment analysis dictionary is described, taking the “Guba” of Shanghai Composite Index on the East Money Website as an example: First, a small batch of scoring is performed using a basic general dictionary before scoring all text subscripts against the sentiment dictionary. In order to avoid bias in text understanding by a single dictionary method, a machine learning method is used to expand the small batch of samples by supervised learning of the scored data already obtained. Following that, by constructing a TF-IDF matrix and removing duplicate words, words that are significant in the text but are not correctly identified by the basic universal dictionary can be further extracted and added to the general dictionary to form an adaptive improvement of the dictionary. Then, a complete scoring is performed using the supplemented automatically expanded dictionary to obtain text sentiment analysis results for the entire data. Then, the results of the basic dictionary measurement and the results based on various machine learning methods are tested together with the artificially labeled data, showing that the adaptively improved text sentiment analysis improves compared to the results of the basic dictionary and outperforms some of the machine learning methods. This improvement is beneficial considering various factors such as computation, comprehension, reliability and cost. In summary, the adaptive improvement method of Chinese text sentiment analysis dictionary proposed in this paper will be inspiring and valuable for Chinese text sentiment analysis, which is quite commonly used in social science research, especially for text sentiment analysis with high specialization, strong budget constraints and high robustness requirements.
