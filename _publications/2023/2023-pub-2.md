abstract: >-
  Constructing China’s independent knowledge system and summarizing China’s unique experience and wisdom are key tasks and major missions to comprehensively promote the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. At present, a new round of deepening reform of SOEs has been fully rolled out, and the Company Law has historically received another overhaul after the 2005 revision, so it is timely to discuss the choice of governance of SOEs. This paper argues that the governance of Chinese SOEs, on the one hand, embodies universal issues that are of great concern to the classical western corporate governance system, such as insider control, principal-agent problems, tunneling, and stakeholder rights, but on the other hand, it is special and complex due to factors such as corporate shareholding structure, social responsibility, and government-enterprise relations, which require special attention and research. Following this, this paper analyzes the consideration and design of the law revision on the governance reform of SOEs from the perspective of the second review draft of the Company Law (Revised Draft), points out the important role and institutional advantages of the CPC’s leadership in the further improvement of the governance of SOEs, and makes a useful discussion on how the CPC’s leadership can be organically combined with corporate governance. The above work is conducive to rationalizing the logic of SOEs governance, improving the effectiveness of SOEs governance, and firmly establishing the path of SOEs governance with Chinese characteristics.
