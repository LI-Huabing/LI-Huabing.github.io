abstract: >-
  The Communist Party of China has led Chinese people to win the battle against poverty and completely eradicate absolute poverty on the land of China after hard and sustained efforts. Against this background, it has become an increasingly important academic and practical issue to evaluate the effectiveness of the poverty alleviation, to promote the orderly connection between the poverty alleviation and rural revitalization, and to guide China’s poverty and rural work for a period of time. This paper considers that the core of the above issue is to investigate the role and contribution of poverty alleviation to China’s high-quality economic development, proposes a method to measure the level of high-quality economic development adapted to rural and poverty issues, and carries out an empirical study on the relationship between poverty alleviation and the level of high-quality economic development based on the Two-way Fixed Effect Model. The empirical results show that the steady progress of poverty alleviation and the reduction of poverty incidence significantly contribute to the high quality development of China’s economy, and that poverty eradication is economic, constructive and sustainable. Following that, this paper carries out robustness tests on the above empirical results, mitigates the endogeneity problem using topographic relief as an Instrumental Variable, and discusses the heterogeneity in terms of geographic space and effects aspects. On this basis, the paper further explores the mechanism between poverty alleviation and high-quality economic development, focusing on the role of consumption upgrading as a key, important mediator in bridging the gap from them, and conducts an empirical test. The empirical results show that the intermediary role of consumption upgrading is significant, as the reduction of poverty incidence raises the consumption level, improves the consumption structure, and alleviates social injustice, which in turn promotes consumption upgrading; consumption upgrading further improves the economic and industrial structure, promotes stable economic growth, raises people’s living standards, and empowers sustainable economic development, which ultimately plays a role in high-quality economic development. Finally, this paper also proposes a method to study poverty at a finer granularity using remote sensing data of nighttime lights, and conducts an empirical exploration. Based on the above empirical findings, the paper concludes with a series of policy recommendations for further poverty eradication, rural revitalization and consumption cultivation.
