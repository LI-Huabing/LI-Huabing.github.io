  <br>
  My main research interest is in law and economics, including empirical legal research, modeling law, and experiments. My thesis will focus on the future of courts reshaped by digitalization. I firmly believe that only exchanges between disciplines and scholars can lead to creations, so that you are always welcome to contact me for academic discussions and collaborations!
