  I am currently a PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html">University of Hamburg</a>, <a href="https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage">University of Bologna</a> and <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en">Erasmus University Rotterdam</a> under <a href="https://edle-phd.eu/">European Doctorate in Law and Economics (EDLE)</a> program, supervised by <a href="https://www.roeesarel.com/">Prof. Dr. Roee Sarel</a> and <a href="https://pure.eur.nl/en/persons/shu-li">Prof. Dr. Shu Li</a>.
  <br>
  My main research interest is in law and economics, including empirical legal research, modeling law, and experiments. My thesis will focus on the future of courts reshaped by digitalization. I firmly believe that only exchanges between disciplines and scholars can lead to creations, so that you are always welcome to contact me for academic discussions and collaborations!
