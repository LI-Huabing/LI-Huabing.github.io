abstract: >-
  The implementation of the Civil Code in 2021 formally marks the era of self-help from past theoretical discussions and practical explorations to the era of law-based article culture. On the one hand, self-help has certain characteristics of public remedies, and on the other hand, it has distinctive characteristics of private remedies, and is commonly applied by the public in social life because of its flexibility and convenience, which has also given rise to many new situations and problems. The study calls for a re-examination of self-help behavior in the "post civil law era". This study starts from the analysis of the private remedy of self-help, and proves that the legislation should uphold a prudent attitude to avoid the proliferation of private remedies. The legislation follows the judiciary, and the judicial attitude affects the implementation of the legislative will and the ecology of self-help practice. It seems to be the right thing to be cautious in legislation and in judiciary, but this paper finds that the two do not naturally need a unified directional arrangement by sorting out the logic of interaction between legislation and judiciary. By establishing a contingent judicial attitude and re-adjudicating 3579 judgments with artificial intelligence-assisted adjudication technology, this paper finds that the existing judicial practice is too cautious in determining self-help behaviors, which is not conducive to the realization of the relief value of self-help behaviors. Through the multidisciplinary perspective of sociology of law and economics of law, we believe that self-help behavior has its meaning and value within the existing remedy system in terms of cultural tradition, normative expectations, and efficiency and risk, and should not be discarded hastily. The prudence of the legislation has set clear boundaries for self-help behavior, and the judiciary can only achieve the optimal utility of self-help relief by being "tolerant in prudence".
