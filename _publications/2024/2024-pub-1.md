abstract: >-
  This paper examines a long-neglected remedy, self-help, using a multifaceted approach within law and economics. First, the paper discusses why self-help is chosen, noting that within the framework of remedy system, self-help is chosen primarily because of the difficulties of the settlement and the dilemmas of the litigation. Second, the paper uses game theory and behavioral economics experiments to model above theories and identifies the potential problems of self-help, namely, its application may be dangerous and under-utilised. To address these issues, the paper uses two causal inference empirical models to answer the question of whether fine-tuning self-help and optimising litigation can benefit self-help practice. The results show that refined legislation on self-help can help promote the rational use of self-help, but attempts to reduce judicial costs and improve its efficiency often tend to be less effective due to insufficient intensity. The discussion in this paper will provide a marginal contribution to a more comprehensive understanding of human's decision-making on rights remedies.
